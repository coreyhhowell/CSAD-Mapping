# CSAD-Mapping
Corcoran School of the Arts and Design – This tool provides a virtual representation built from laser measurements of the Corcoran gallery and student spaces, allowing artists and designers to see how their work will look and make adjustments as needed. This helps to ensure that the installation process goes smoothly.

## Usage
Use these documents and PNG images to get accurate measurements of spaces you're interested in showing your work. **FOR 2024**, each Word/PDF file has a link to the SketchUp platform where you can explore these spaces virtually. Drop in images of you art and scale to the accurate dimensions and you will have a rough idea of how it could look in reality. This tool was built for students leading up to NEXT 2024. *The continuity of the links in these documents will not last past 2024 and will eventually be dead links.* 

The **.skp (SketchUp)** file is included for each space. Upload the .skp to [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/ "SketchUp Link") to view the space virtually if documents links have gone down.
